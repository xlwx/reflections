We can view the difference between two versions of a file can find the bugs by looking at the "-" and  "+" marks.

With easy access to the entire history of a file, I am able to track each phase of the development process.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
~ pros: to make sure the commit is neither too big nor too small.
~ cons: when some accidents are happening, you didn't backup the file and you may loose important changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because such version control sustems are for programming, where one resource could be shared by multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
1. got into the file folder
2. type 'git log' to get the commit id
3. use 'git diff first_version second_version' to compare tow files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can easily get back to the previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Of course I will try to use Git for my progect.
